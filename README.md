New and Improved Horiseon Webpage

I have improved the accessibility standards of the webpage and made the code easier to understand by other developers. It is also more accessible on mobile devices improving brand visibility. 

I sectioned off parts of the code using HTML semantics and gave the code logical structure by grouping classes with similar attributes. I also rearranged parts of the .css so that the code has a logical structure beginning with the header and ending with the footer. I then added alt attributes to all the images whcih improves the webpage's accessibility.
