New and Improved Horiseon Webpage

I have improved the accessibility standards of the webpage. It is now easier to read by other developers and is more accessible on mobile devides improving brand visibility. 

I sectioned off parts of the code using HTML semantics giving the code logical structure. I also added alt attributes to all the images
